# Berries
Still life art of berries, looks tasty 🍓 🫐 
I was completely out of ideas and didn't know what to draw. Then I looked around the room and noticed these delicate-looking berries. I arranged them together in sunlight to create a nice depth effect. I started by sketching the outer layer shapes and then focused on detailing the roundness of the strawberries and the small, spiky leaves of the blueberries.
